server has been put up on vps server so you just login and join any people.

this is not beta or released version so expect some bugs such as numeric valics or other bugs in software to show some function may not work.
does not affect the use of zerotier.

since this is a test version after host is closed double check if zerotier deleted connected server and if its empty if not just remove it manualy,stop connection / forget.

in final release it will be all ok.

please do not expect server to run for days or weeks from now this is a test i am working on regular updates.
